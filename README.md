Module 1 Challenge - Mario Palozzo


This code is an overall more optimised version of the original code of the website. I wished to remake this page in order to allow for improved readability and usability for those who are to work with the code in the future, as well as for viewers of the webpage to enjoy a better overall user experience.

While this page looks identical to the original, the HTML and CSS files have been reworked in order to allow my goals to be achieved. This has been done in a number of ways, including:

* The rearrangement and replacement of CSS selectors and properties and HTMl elements

* Comments added throughout the HTML page to allow viewers of the code to more easily follow the structure of the page

* Each of the images now having alt attributes that will be shown if the user is unable to view the image

* Each of the links now working in their intended way, an improvement from the starter code as the "Search Engine Optimization" link previously did not work.

* A more descriptive title

Throughout the remodelling of this webpage, I came to better understand the importance of code opimisation and efficiency, as the ease of use of the code was very different between the initial starting position and the final product.

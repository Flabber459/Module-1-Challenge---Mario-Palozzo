# Module 1 Challenge - Mario Palozzo

## Description

This piece of code is a more optimised version of the original "Horiseon" website code. I remade this page in order to allow for improved readability and usability for those who are to work with the code in the future, as well as to allow viewers of the webpage to enjoy a better overall user experience.

Whilst this page appears identical to the original from the viewer's perspective, the HTML and CSS files have been reworked in order to allow me to achieve my goals. This has been done in a number of ways, including:

* The rearrangement and replacement of CSS selectors and properties and HTMl elements, including the addition of semantic elements

* Comments added throughout the HTML page to allow viewers of the code to more easily follow the structure of the page

* Each of the images now having alt attributes indicating text that will be shown if the user is unable to view the image

* Each of the links now works in their intended manner, an improvement from the starter code as previously only some of them worked

* A more descriptive title to allow for improved optimisation in google search functions

* Other more general improvements to the source code

This project allowed me to improve my knowledge of web-based coding through more practical use of the content I have learnt during the USYD Bootcamp. More specifically, throughout the remodelling of this webpage, I came to better understand the importance of code opimisation and efficiency. This became evident to me over time as there was a noticeable difference between the initial code and the final product in terms of being able to view and manipulate the code.

## Usage

The webpage is opened by using a standard URL, as shown below:

Live URL:
https://flabber459.github.io/Module-1-Challenge---Mario-Palozzo/

The functions of the webpage involve links in the navigation bar at the top of the page, taking the user to the relevant section of the page.

## Credits

The original source code was made available to me through the USYD Bootcamp Spot page. I reworked the files myself in order to attain the final product.
